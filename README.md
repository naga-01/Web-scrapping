## Implementation of Web Scrapping in python with Beautiful Soup

#### There are 3 steps involved in Web Scrapping
#### 1. Sending HTTP requests to URL of the webpage we want to access. Server responds by returning HTML content of the webpage
#### 2. HTML data is nested and difficult to traverse/access the data. So we have to parse the HTML data. Parsing helps to create Tree structure of HTML data.
#### 3. Now we need to traverse and search the parse tree,..i.e Tree traversal. For that, I have used Beautiful Soup
